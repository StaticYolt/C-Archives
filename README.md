### Welcome to the C Archives, a dynamic and expansive community based library that works towards holding the knowledge of all the quirks and nuances of the C programming language.

## Rules

- Don’t post all your homework questions here, try to find at least some other way of framing it
- When posting, please keep them readable via one of our templates or through some other markdown format
- Be respectful, all of us are learners here

## Discussions

### Announcements

- Reserved for policy and jupyter notebook changes and similar posts

### Q&A

- Would contain posts in a flexible format trying to resolve some issue.
- An answered Q&A Post would mean that the original question/issue has been successfully answered

### Experiments

- Contains structured and detailed posts to test a hypothesis to find a conclusion about the C Programming Language
- Each experiment should contain: Hypothesis, Code, Test Cases, Output, Conclusion, and Limitations (optional)
- An answered Experiment post means it has been verified by someone knowledgable in C

## Jupyter Notebooks

Inspiration of this idea comes from these Jupyter notebooks for a machine learning course: 

https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/00_pytorch_fundamentals.ipynb

The purpose of these notebooks is to provide a contained resource to learn and test material, saving beginners time and energy.

Content inside these notebooks would contain the most relevant verified experiments with context for some broader understanding on why that experiment is important in the first place.

### Going from Q&A to Jupyter Notebooks

Q&A → Experiment → Verified Experiment → Jupyter Notebook

Thanks for reading and I hope this platform helps on your coding adventure!

## Standard
C version is c17 and compiler is gcc -std=c11

Not Standard is everything else
